Create a repository on github named "python-build" and send us the link. you will upload your work to this repo.

Dataset selection:
Use: https://github.com/buildforbharat/datasets
infy_stock.csv: Source OCLHV data for NSE stocks (INFY) between 2015-2016. Data level - Daily.
nifty_it_index.csv: Source OCLHV data for NIFTY IT index. Data level - Daily.

Part 1:
1. Load this data into Mysql. Please write a python script for this. do NOT use raw SQL. You can use pymysql or sqlalchemy or any library.
2. Using SQL, Create 4,16,....,52 week moving average(closing price) for each stock and index.
3. Create rolling window of size 10 on each stock/index. Remember that MySQL lacks window functions, but you can do a similar computation using self-joins (or any other method).

Part 2:
1. All subsequent questions from this point will be done by reading from mysql into python+pandas (the tables you created previously) . You will no longer read from CSV files or do this in raw SQL. We will run your python code and see if you are loading it appropriately.
2. Create 4,16,....,52 week moving average(closing price) for each stock and index. This should happen through a function.
3. Create rolling window of size 10 on each stock/index. Handle unequal time series due to stock market holidays. 
4. Create the following dummy time series:
   4.1 Volume shocks - If volume traded is 10% higher/lower than previous day - make a 0/1 boolean time series for shock, 0/1 dummy-coded time series for direction of shock.
   4.2 Price shocks - If closing price at T vs T+1 has a difference > 2%, then 0/1 boolean time series for shock, 0/1 dummy-coded time series for direction of shock.

Part 3 (data visualization ):
For this section, you can use only bokeh. https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html
1. Create timeseries plot of close prices of stocks/indices with the following features:
2. Color timeseries in simple blue color.
3. Color timeseries between two volume shocks in a different color (Red)
4. Gradient color in blue spectrum based on difference of 52 week moving average.
